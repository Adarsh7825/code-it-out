# Sales Dashboard Challenge

## Overview
This is a coding assignment that tests your React skills. You'll be working with a sales dashboard application that displays data, allows for data manipulation, and visualizes trends. The existing code has bugs, missing features, and areas for improvement that you'll need to address.

## Assignment Requirements

### 1. Bug Fixing (30% of grade)
The application contains several bugs that affect its functionality. Your task is to identify and fix these issues. Some examples include:
- Incorrect data processing for charts
- Broken delete functionality
- Issues with key props in lists
- Form validation problems
- Sorting implementation bugs

### 2. Feature Enhancement (40% of grade)
Implement the following new features:
1. **Dashboard Summary Statistics**
   - Add a summary section with key metrics (total sales, average sales, best-selling product, etc.)
   - Implement visual indicators for performance changes

2. **Data Export**
   - Add functionality to export the data as CSV or JSON
   - Include options to export filtered/sorted data

3. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Implement date range filtering
   - Add multi-select filtering for categories and regions
   - Create a visual filter builder

4. **Data Visualization Enhancements**
   - Fix the broken pie chart implementation
   - Add a stacked bar chart for category/region comparisons
   - Implement interactive tooltips with detailed information
   - Add trend analysis (month-over-month growth, etc.)

### 3. Code Quality & Organization (30% of grade)
Improve the overall code quality by:
- Using proper React patterns and best practices
- Implementing proper component composition
- Adding error boundaries and proper error handling
- Ensuring responsive design works correctly
- Adding appropriate PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces
- Implementing unit tests for key functionality
- Adding meaningful comments and documentation
- Optimizing performance where applicable

## Assessment Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated on:

1. **Functionality**: Does the application work as expected? Are all bugs fixed?
2. **Implementation**: How well are new features implemented? Are they intuitive to use?
3. **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, following React best practices?
4. **Performance**: Does the application perform well, without unnecessary re-renders?
5. **UI/UX**: Is the interface responsive, accessible, and user-friendly?
